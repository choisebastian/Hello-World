# Hello-World
The first repository in the GitHub
Hello! Nice to meet you! I am Sebastian Choi a new briliant developer in Python and Java.
I would like to develop work related with P2P messanger so enhance work performance and assess performance accurately.
This app idea is simple. It's based on agreement and negotiation between empoyer and employee by contracct.
Employer offer short-middle-long term assignment(job lists) and employee do it by completion or ongoing or deny with comment and employer assesses it with agreement.
